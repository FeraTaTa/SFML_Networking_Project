To run the application just open the .exe file in EXE folder and when prompted firstly enter 's' to set the first peer as the host application, open the second instance and enter 'c' to set it as the client application. This should set up the connection and the game is ready to start.

To play simply click on the ball to start and to hit the ball just make sure your paddle collides with the ball by using the mouse position.

Source code is in the SFML_Networking_Project folder along with a resource folder which contains the paddle sprites and a config folder which contains a window.ini. 

In the window.ini file the 5th line is blank by default, this will set the network classes in localHost mode, to define your own target ip address simply enter the ip on this line.

Here is a link to a video in which I test the game with undesirable network conditions: https://vimeo.com/378376529
